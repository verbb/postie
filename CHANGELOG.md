- Add "Pack items individually" packing method, allowing all line items and quantities to be boxes individually.
- Add "Pack items into boxes" packing method, allowing provider-supplied boxes, or user-created ones.
- Add "Pack items into a single box" packing method - a slightly improved version of the box-packing algorithm in pre 2.4.0. This ensures a non-breaking change to box-packing behaviour to date.
- Add `EVENT_BEFORE_PACK_ORDER` and `EVENT_AFTER_PACK_ORDER` events to all providers, allowing modification of the box-packing logic.
- Add "Restrict Shipping Methods" setting for all providers. This allows opt-out of restricting to certain shipping services, and always use whatever is returned by the provider. This is particularly beneficial for some providers where services can't always be determined.

- Add API connection testing for all providers, allowing you to troubleshoot API credentials before getting to shipping.
- Add `supportsConnection()`, `checkConnection()` and `getIsConnected()` methods to providers.
- Add testing classes for addresses and packages. Can be freely used to fetch a range of different values for testing responses.

### Changed
- Postie now requires PHP 7.1+.
- Multiple packages are now possible for Australia Post, DHL Express and TNT Australia. This not only improves a "too large to ship" response, but should provide more accurate pricing overall. Previously, Postie bundled all items in a single package, which would often go over maximum dimensions/weights.
- Existing providers now use the "Pack items into a single box" box packing algorithm. This is essentially the same as previous versions to prevent a breaking change.
- Tidied up the shipping methods table for providers.
- Some internal cleanup with providers (may affect custom providers). Refer to the [updated docs](https://verbb.io/craft-plugins/postie/docs/developers/provider).

- Add missing Fedex UK Domestic services.
- Add Pickup Type option for UPS. You may want to change this to “Customer Counter” for more accurate UPS results, but do test this for your own needs. The default is left as-is (“Daily Pickup”) so as not to be a breaking change.
