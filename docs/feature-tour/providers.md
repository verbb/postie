Each provider has the following settings available to configure.

## API Settings
Every provider will require different API settings, so this section will change depending on the individual provider. See each [Shipping Provider](docs:shipping-providers) for more details.

## Markup
You can set up a markup for every provider, which is useful to cover packing costs or other incidental costs. You can select this value to be either a **Percentage** or **Value**.

- **Percentage** — Add a markup based on the total order price. Add a markup rate between 1 and 100 to calculate a percentage.
- **Value** — Add just a pure value on top of the total order price. For example, "5" for $5.
